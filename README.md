## What is this?

These are my notes for that specific class on my 2nd semester of the computer science bachelor.
During this class we saw everything about data structures and computer algorithms in C++. This project does not run because it is a folder with all of the projects done in the semester. If you wish to try any of the code in this repository just create a new project in your computer and copy paste the code to that new project.
